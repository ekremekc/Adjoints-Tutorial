# 3D Examples

We aim to further develop 3D solutions with helezon. This file includes three dimensional examples with/without heat sources.

- `mesh.py`

This file construct the mesh file. We apply mesh refinement on cube geometry in the middle.

- `main.py`

Main calculation file to specify boundary conditions and it obtains solution in serial/parallel calculation.

- `params.py`

This file keeps the problem parameters.

- `run.sh`

Example commands for serial and parallel calculations can be seen in this file.
